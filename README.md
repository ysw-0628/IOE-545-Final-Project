# IOE-545-Final-Project

In Washtenaw county, there are thousands of COVID testings happening in one day. Are there any smart and easy-to-implement inventory control solutions behind the hustle and bustle in pharmacies, care centers or all kinds of testing sites and vaccination spots? How to balance efficiency and wastage among the distribution network? Furthermore, when the demands/customers show up based on appointment systems and have different preferences, are there any ways to catch up, or even interfere in a positive way?

As a course project, we set the objectives to be threefold: 1) Clearly identify and describe a problem that is both of practical validity and research relevance; 2) Build up a model that captures key decision making processes with proper simplification and abstraction; 3) Conduct numerical analysis from an operational point of view, with data as real as possible in one specific region, and report our findings in an organized way.
